# Build an Apartment Starter Project

This project is part of [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com "Udacity - Be in demand")'s [VR Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/vr-developer-nanodegree--nd017).

## Versions
- Unity 2017.1.0p4
- GVR Unity SDK v1.70.0



## Pedro Gonzalez notes
- I have started learning Blender, the chair close to the globe is created by me, although I had problems adding textures to it.
- Some of the items have custom materials and textures I added, as practice. Even the sofa has a normal map. All textures are from free and no-attribution-needed sources. No items from the Asset Store are used.
- I had problems with the initial setuop of the vr camera. The process to add Gvr has changed and not well described in the lesson, in my opinion.
- Other than that, it was a lot of fun.
